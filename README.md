## Overview :
The dataset contains 100 wildfire incidents in California, with 11 columns capturing key details such as:
Date & Location: When and where the fire occurred.
Area Burned (Acres): Size of the affected land.
Damages: Number of homes, businesses, and vehicles destroyed.
Casualties: Injuries and fatalities.
Financial Loss: Estimated loss in millions of dollars.
Cause: Factors contributing to the wildfire (e.g., Lightning, Human Activity, Unknown).

## Dataset :
The dataset includes the following file:

## Insights :
1.Severe Financial Losses: Wildfires have caused significant financial damage, with losses reaching into the billions.

2.High Casualties: There are multiple fatalities and injuries across different incidents, highlighting the human cost.

3.Main Causes: Lightning-Triggered Fires cause the highest financial losses.

4.Variability in Damage: Some wildfires cause extensive destruction (thousands of homes destroyed), while others are less severe.

5.Frequent Wildfire-Prone Locations: Counties like Sonoma and Shasta appear multiple times, suggesting they are high-risk areas.

## Recommendation :
1.Early Detection Systems: Install weather-based lightning trackers to predict high-risk areas.

2.Lightning Rods: Protect power lines and critical infrastructure from igniting.

3.Public Awareness & Fire Safety Training: Educate communities on campfire safety, cigarette disposal, and equipment use.

4.Stronger Law Enforcement: Increase penalties for arson and negligence.

5.Surveillance & Drones: Deploy aerial monitoring to track potential fire hazards.

6.Stricter Fire Regulations: Enhance policies for land management and wildfire mitigation.

7.Lightning-Triggered Fires cause the highest financial lossesâ€”improving early detection and fuel management is key.

8.Unknown Causes need better forensic tracking and surveillance.

9.Human-Related Fires can be reduced through education, stronger laws, and infrastructure maintenance.
